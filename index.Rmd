## R Markdown



This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

officials$name <- paste0("[", officials$name, "](", officials$urls, ")")

yea <- officials %>%
  group_by(photoUrl != "NA") %>%
  mutate(paste0("![image](", photoUrl, ")")) 

kable(officials)
```




## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
